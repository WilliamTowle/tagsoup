  tagsoup.sh is a simple script for downloading and analysing web
content, derived from an earlier script called relay.sh.

  tagsoup.sh extends the document-flattening effect of relay.sh with
some supplementary commands, which when fleshed out as desired (there
is guidance in the relevant places) are capable of filtering the list
of links/images produced. Likely filters you may desire include but
are not limited to:
- limit links to ones that are strictly-on-site documents
- limit image links to those that go off-site
- display only inline images with a particular file extension

  tagsoup.sh has the following usage:
	| ./tagsoup.sh: Usage:
	| 	get)		## retrieve page/file
	| 	separate)	## 'get' with layout readjustment, one tag per line
	| 	ahref)		## 'separate', filter anchor tags, show href=
	| 	imgsrc)		## 'separate', filter img tags, show src=
	| 	dumplinks)	## site-sensitive 'ahref' filtering
	| 	dumpimgs)	## site-sensitive 'imgsrc' filtering
